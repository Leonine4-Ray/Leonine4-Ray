- 👋 Hi, I’m @Leonine4-Ray
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a top notch well rounded software developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Well I don't exactly know what as yet, but I am certainly look forward to collaborating!
- 📫 How to reach me work.raypaul@gmail.com.

I have had various types of jobs throughout my life, but it is only now at 36yrs old I found software development, and boy am I in love!
This just fits me so perfectly!
I had no idea I could be self taught, nor had I any clue that so much quality information is available for free online, even for a CS Degree!
In addition to which, the coding community is so willing to help. This is a world I wish I had discovered in my single and free teenage years.
I have never felt this alive and excited. 
I look forward to meeting new people and making some interesting global friends.
